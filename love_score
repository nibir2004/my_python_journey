#It's actually a game where this code take 2 name like your name and your lover name then count wach of word true first and seocnodly it will count letters love
#after that it will just add 2 of them separately that becomes the love score 
#example first_name = tanvir 
#second_name = israt
#score 41 because true = 4 
#and love = 1  # i think this wiill be funny for those couple who are like coke and mentos ha ha
